# A Big Ol' Bucket o' Scooped Ham! ðŸª£
A **[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)** bucket for amateur radio programs!
## If you already have Scoop
```pwsh
scoop bucket add ham https://github.com/KO6FCH/scoop-ham
```
There's a [list of supported programs below](#scoop-ham.programs). Have fun!
## What is Scoop?
> Scoop installs programs you know and love, from the command line with a minimal amount of friction.

<sup>:link: https://scoop.sh/</sup>
## How do I?
### 1. Install Scoop
> Open a PowerShell terminal (version 5.1 or later) and from the PS C:\> prompt, run:
> ```pwsh
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
> Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
> ```
<sup>:link: https://scoop.sh/</sup>

And if you don't already have it installed, you'll need `git`.
```pwsh
scoop install git
```
### 2. Add the **scoop-ham** bucket
```pwsh
scoop bucket add ham https://github.com/KO6FCH/scoop-ham
```
### 3. Install Programs
One at a time.
```pwsh
scoop install wsjtx
```
A bunch at once.
```pwsh
scoop install wsjtx gridtracker chirp
```
### 4. Update Programs
One at a time.
```pwsh
scoop update wsjtx
```
A bunch at once.
```pwsh
scoop update wsjtx chirp gridtracker
```
Everything.
```pwsh
scoop update *
```
